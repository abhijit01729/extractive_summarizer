This project is to create a user-friendly interface for extractive text summarization using PyQt, enabling users to input text and receive concise summaries with a single click.
The sumy library is used to implement extractive summarization technique, leveraging the LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) summarizer to generate summary.
Using the nltk library NLP capability is implemented to enhance text tokenization and preprocessing.
Used PyInstaller to package the application as a standalone executable, generating the extractive_summarizer.spec file as a result.
